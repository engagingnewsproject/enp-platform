Allows post authors to easily add and manage footnotes in posts and pages.

== Description ==

Footnotes Made Easy is a simple but powerful plugin for adding footnotes to your WordPress posts and pages. Wrap any text in double parentheses, and it becomes a footnote; automatically numbered, linked, and displayed at the bottom of your content.

**Full documentation is available at [docs.altvisewp.com/footnotes-made-easy](https://docs.altvisewp.com/footnotes-made-easy/)**

**Key features:**

* Simple inline syntax — wrap text in `(( ))` to create a footnote anywhere in a post or page
* Combine identical footnotes automatically
* Paginated post support with manual start number control
* Reference a previous footnote by number using `((ref:1))`
* Pretty tooltips — show footnote content on hover using jQuery
* Suppress footnotes on specific page types (home, archives, search, feeds)
* Exclude footnotes from specific post categories or custom URLs
* Dashboard with live usage stats; footnote counts across all posts and pages
* Export/import Footnotes Made Easy settings across different sites
* Multisite support; network-managed mode or per-subsite override
* Compatible with the Classic Editor and the Gutenberg block editor
* Lots of configuration options

**Footnotes Made Easy is a fork of [WP Footnotes](https://github.com/drzax/wp-footnotes "Github - wp-footnotes"), a plugin by Simon Elvery.**

**For the latest code, planned enhancements and known issues, visit the [GitHub page](https://github.com/altvisewp/footnotes-made-easy/s "Github").**

== Getting Started ==

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl9p2-lSZMU]

Creating a footnote is simple; wrap your footnote text in double parentheses:

`This is a sentence ((and this is your footnote)).`

The footnote will appear at the bottom of your post or page, automatically numbered and linked.

**Important:** Include a space before your opening double parentheses or the footnote will not work.

== Settings ==

The settings page is organised into four tabs:

* **Display** — Control footnote identifier style, back-link format, header and footer text, and tooltip behaviour.
* **Behaviour** — Configure combining identical footnotes, back-link position, and processing priority.
* **Suppress** — Choose which page types (home, archives, search, feeds, previews) should not display footnotes. Also suppress by post type and exclude footnotes from specific URLs or post categories
* **Advanced** — Change the opening and closing delimiters.

== Paginated Posts ==

By default, each page of a paginated post restarts footnote numbering from 1. To maintain a continuous sequence, add a start number tag between each `<!--nextpage-->` marker:

`<!--startnum=5-->`

Replace `5` with the number you want the first footnote on that page to start at.

== Referencing ==

To reference a previous footnote a second time, you can either repeat the exact same text (recommended — works with the Combine Identical Footnotes option) or use the number reference syntax:

`((ref:1))`

Note: number referencing does not work across pages in a paginated post, and risks pointing to the wrong footnote if new footnotes are inserted before it. The exact-text method is more robust.

== Multisite Support ==

On WordPress multisite networks, the plugin can be configured from the network admin in two modes:

* **Network managed** — all settings controlled centrally; the Footnotes menu is hidden from subsite admins
* **Subsite override** — each subsite admin can manage their own footnote settings independently

== Available in 8 Languages ==

== Installation ==

Footnotes Made Easy can be found and installed via the Plugin menu within WordPress administration (Plugins → Add New). Alternatively, download from WordPress.org and install manually:

1. Upload the entire `footnotes-made-easy` folder to your `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress administration.

No configuration required — the plugin works immediately after activation with the default `(( ))` syntax.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add a footnote? =

Wrap your footnote text in double parentheses anywhere in your post or page content:

`This is a sentence ((and this is your footnote)).`

The plugin replaces the marker with a numbered superscript and appends the reference at the bottom of the post.

= Can I change the `(( ))` syntax to something else? =

Yes. Go to **Footnotes → Footnotes Settings → Advanced** and set custom opening and closing delimiters.

= Can I style the footnotes output? =

Yes. Use the CSS editor in your theme customiser. `ol.footnotes` targets the footnotes list and `ol.footnotes li` targets individual footnotes.

= Can I disable footnotes on specific pages or categories? =

Yes. The **Suppress** tab lets you disable footnotes on the home page, archives, search results, feeds, and previews. The **Advanced** tab lets you exclude specific URLs or post categories.

= Does the plugin work with the block editor (Gutenberg)? =

Yes. Add the `(( ))` syntax directly inside any text block.

= Does the plugin work on multisite? =

Yes. See the Multisite section above for configuration details.

= Does the plugin remove its data when uninstalled? =

Yes. Deleting the plugin via the WordPress admin removes all stored settings and user meta from the database. If you want to preserve settings for a future reinstall, enable the **Preserve settings on uninstall** option in the Tools page before deleting.

= Where can I find the full documentation? =

Full documentation is at [docs.altvisewp.com/footnotes-made-easy](https://docs.altvisewp.com/footnotes-made-easy/).
