== Description ==

= Forms that grow with your business =
As one of WordPress’ oldest form builders, we’re proud to serve users from around the world, from all walks of life, and from different stages of online growth. From the small businesses and local nonprofits that make up the core Ninja Forms user base to universities, hospitals, and even Fortune 500 companies, we’ll scale with you from startup to wherever you’re aiming for.

We’re committed to offering as many free, open source tools as we can get away with to back you up in the extremely price-conscious early days. As you grow, pick and choose only the premium features you need as you need them. We’ll grow with you from there for as far as you want to take us.

We’re also committed to respecting your privacy and time. No unsolicited emails or aggressive marketing. No paywalling basic features or scraping private data. We offer a fully staffed team of support experts and a comprehensive library of plugin documentation for all users, free and paid, to help keep you collecting the submissions that move your business forward.

We look forward to seeing where you’ll take us!
