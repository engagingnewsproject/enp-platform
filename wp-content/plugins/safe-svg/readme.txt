Enable SVG uploads and sanitize them to stop XML/SVG vulnerabilities in your WordPress website.

== Description ==

Safe SVG is the best way to Allow SVG Uploads in WordPress!

It gives you the ability to allow SVG uploads whilst making sure that they're sanitized to stop SVG/XML vulnerabilities affecting your site.  It also gives you the ability to preview your uploaded SVGs in the media library in all views.

#### Current Features
* **Sanitised SVGs** - Don't open up security holes in your WordPress site by allowing uploads of unsanitised files.
* **SVGO Optimisation** - Runs your SVGs through the SVGO tool on upload to save you space. This feature is disabled by default but can be enabled by adding the following code: `add_filter( 'safe_svg_optimizer_enabled', '__return_true' );`
* **View SVGs in the Media Library** - Gone are the days of guessing which SVG is the correct one, we'll enable SVG previews in the WordPress media library.
* **Choose Who Can Upload** - Restrict SVG uploads to certain users on your WordPress site or allow anyone to upload.

Initially a proof of concept for [#24251](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24251).

SVG Sanitization is done through the following library: [https://github.com/darylldoyle/svg-sanitizer](https://github.com/darylldoyle/svg-sanitizer).

SVG Optimization is done through the following library: [https://github.com/svg/svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo).

== Installation ==

Install through the WordPress directory or download, unzip and upload the files to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can we change the allowed attributes and tags? =

Yes, this can be done using the `svg_allowed_attributes` and `svg_allowed_tags` filters.
They take one argument that must be returned. See below for examples:

    add_filter( 'svg_allowed_attributes', function ( $attributes ) {

        // Do what you want here...

        // This should return an array so add your attributes to
        // to the $attributes array before returning it. E.G.

        $attributes[] = 'target'; // This would allow the target="" attribute.

        return $attributes;
    } );


    add_filter( 'svg_allowed_tags', function ( $tags ) {

        // Do what you want here...

        // This should return an array so add your tags to
        // to the $tags array before returning it. E.G.

        $tags[] = 'use'; // This would allow the <use> element.

        return $tags;
    } );
