* New: To help us improve the plugin we have added usage tracking so that we can understand what features and settings are being used, and which features matter to you the most.

No personal or sensitive data is collected (such as email addresses, Twitter account information, license keys, etc). You can opt-out by simply disabling the setting at: Twitter Feed > Customize > Misc > Enable Usage Tracking. See [here](https://smashballoon.com/custom-twitter-feeds/docs/usage-tracking/) for more information.
