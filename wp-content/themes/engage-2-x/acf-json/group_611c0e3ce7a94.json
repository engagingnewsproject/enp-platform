            "default_value": "The Center for Media Engagement at The University of Texas at Austin hosted a roundtable about the public interest standard to discuss the current state of the public interest standard and what, if any, improvements need to be made. The virtual event took place on May 10, 2021 and was moderated by Marley Duchovnay, Caroline Murray, and Talia Stroud. Experts who participated drew from their experience in the professional fields of law, government, research, education, advocacy, and journalism. Experts in attendance included:\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Christopher Ali, Associate Professor in the Department of Media Studies at the University of Virginia;\r\nYosef Getachew, Media and Democracy Program Director of Common Cause;\r\nCatherine Sandoval, Associate Professor of Law at the University of Santa Clara;\r\nSteven Waldman, President and Co-Founder of Report for America.<\/p>\r\nWhat is the public interest standard?\r\n\r\nThe roots of the public interest standard trace back to the 1920s when the government first set out to address problems with radio signal interference and sparse radio spectrum with the passage of the Radio Act of 1927. The Act established a relationship between government and radio stations where the government would assign frequencies and licenses to stations and, in return, stations were expected to serve “the public interest, convenience or necessity.”\r\n\r\nYears later, to improve upon the Radio Act of 1926, Congress passed the Communications Act of 1934. This Act established the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which still governs radio and broadcast television licenses today, and established criteria to guide the Commission’s licensing powers. The law emphasized that license recipients should operate in “the public interest, convenience or necessity.”\r\n\r\nHow exactly did stations prove that they were serving the public interest? While requirements have changed over the standard’s lifetime, two key elements were that 10% of a station’s programming needed to be non-entertainment and that stations were required to determine the information needs of their local community by meeting with community members (a process called ascertainment). Today, all that remains of the public interest standard is the requirement that licensed stations must maintain an “issues\/programs list” which notes examples of programming that serve in the public interest. The problem is that these lists aren’t filed with the FCC. In order for the public to access the lists, they need to visit the main office of the licensed station and request the list in person. Steven Waldman’s 2011 FCC report, “The Information Needs of Communities,” cites problematic examples of issues\/programs lists that included advertisements for an America’s Next Top Model audition and a contest to win a Dairy Queen cake as programs that served the public interest.\r\n\r\nThis led us to ask: What are the primary issues with the public interest standard today? And what can be done to address them?",

In the first 75 years of the FCC’s existence it granted over 100,000 license renewals. In only four cases was a renewal application denied because the licensee failed to meet its public interest programming obligations...” explains panelist Steven Waldman. Christopher Ali points out that there seems to be a shift from the belief that the public interest standard is about a broadcaster’s responsibility to the public. Previously implemented regulations that were beneficial to the public interest, such as ascertainment and the main studio rule, are no longer in effect.",
